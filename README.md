# PasswordManagement

This a C#.NET project using WPF. It can currently be used to generate random passwords, with varying length from 5-25; capital letters; punctuation of many varieties; and numerals.

To use it run the program, click the "Generator" button, then choose the option you want for your password, then hit the "Generate!" button. Finally copy the password from the text box.

Plans:

*Use WPF to colour the screen, using some wavy patter or sumat, based on how secure the password is
*Add secure Password STorage??
